Welcome to my first blog post.  This blog will be a home for random
thoughts I may have but also as a test case for various technologies commonly used in enterprise hosting.  To that end, the following technologies are used for this site:

* Hexo
* AWS S3

At some point I will post a blog entry on how this web site is made and deployed.

As for the reason Hexo is used, that primarily boils down to wanting to author the blog posts in Markdown.  Other then that, it offers all the basic features I wanted such as the ability to tag and categorize posts and also be able to add arbitrary pages.
